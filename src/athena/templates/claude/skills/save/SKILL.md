description: Quicksave a checkpoint to the current Athena session log
argument-hint: "[summary of work completed]"

# /save

Save a checkpoint to the current session log:

```bash
athena save "$ARGUMENTS"
```

If no summary is provided, generate one from the recent work.

If the `athena` command is not available, fall back to:
1. Find today's session log in `.context/memories/session_logs/`
2. Append a checkpoint block with timestamp and summary
3. Confirm: "Checkpoint saved."

Proactively suggest `/save` when:
- A meaningful chunk of work is completed
- Before large refactors or schema changes
- Before switching topics
- The conversation has been running for a while without a save
